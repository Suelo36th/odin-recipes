    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced bell peppers, any color</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 hot chile pepper, seeded and finely chopped, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, bell peppers, and garlic; cook and stir
            until the vegetables have softened and the onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine the tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, chile pepper into a bowl and mix briefly. Pour the tomato
            mixture into the skillet, and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer, uncovered, until the tomato juices have cooked off, about 10 minutes. Make four indentations in the
            tomato mixture for the eggs. Crack the eggs into the indentations. Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook
            until they're firm but not dry, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
